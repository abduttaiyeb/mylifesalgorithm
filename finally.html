                <p>
                    Waking up before the clock, "Kya time hua bhenchod", I thought to myself, happily with curiosity before my eyes to see her adorable face and feel the level reaching the checkpoint by feeling her beautiful presence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was early, yet I felt late, I wasn't able to spend my patience for time to unwrap. There was Ecstasy along with fear hidden deep inside, Perhaps, my heart was crossing the peak thinking and pre-planning the way I would spend my time with her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Controling the urge to grab her tight and hug her till the heart beats sync, I walked besides with a cocktail of Peace and Chaos in my mind fighting with present and future events yet to occur. That instance I felt that she is the one to whom I'll always look upon in my ups and downs, without having a second thought. cause she is the one whose Hands get my hell of a stress down the bar when held.               </p>
                <p>
                    The joy I was experiencing was still at the peak while waiting for her to walk into my house before walking down the aisle. Will it be a <a href="./">Yes</a> or a <a href="./">No</a>, the question was killing me, even though the calculations were at place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <a href="./">Chat</a> began, Chaos got a bonus against peace, Later the minutes, the wind of happiness was blown, when I finally heard the statements I only had imagined. It was all because of her that made a regular day marked important in my calendar, It wasn't less than a bollywood drama, Perhaps, I'd say it was even more dramatic, the feeling I felt, blooming in my heart, and feeling butterflies all packed inside of me, But my silly brain was unable to process the hormones. And it all got even better when I carried her down the stairs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was moving closer to the present I imagined in the past as my future. Got all cleaned and confused with happiness, "Kyare aawse yaar aa ghost??", I kept on questioning myself every second I saw my wrist. 
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt><strong>gh&bull;o&bull;st</strong></dt>
                    <dd>
                        <em>noun</em><br>
                        the girl I fuckin love and wish to irritate always.
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                <p>
                    The dream was about to turn into reality, the moment she stepped in. I sat besides her seeing her happy smile and laugh, "Mane to kai aapo", I said, but all I ever wanted was her and only HER.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The list started building up internally with an overthinking nature:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Responsibilities</li>
                    <li>
                        Need to keep her always happy, <em>what if am not able to???</em>.
                    </li>
                    <li>What happens next??</li>
                    <li>Gotta earn more anyhow</li>
                    <li>I never want her to leave, how to I keep it all best</li>
                    <li>She's the top priority, I gotta change to keep her away from my mess</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I was adding marks to my shit. In my true fashion, I got carried away with "What ifs." 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        "She was the rhythm to my poem, <mark>She made my life fun to live</mark>?"
                        <ul>
                            I was watching her hold <mark class="pink">pink</mark>,
                            <li>"<mark class="blue">Blue</mark>"</li>
                            <li>"<mark class="green">Green</mark>"</li>
                            <li>"<mark class="orange">Orange</mark>"</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li><br>
                    I didn't get <s>anything</s><sup>Except from my Maa's family</sup> Yet I got what I prayed for
                    
                </ul>
                <p>
                    "Mubarak" was what I was hearing, but the response had the thank I wanted to give for accepting my prayers saying "Alhumdolillah".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Saw the conversion where except of good grades I acheived the one I loved and promised myself to never let go of her amd spend my entire life with her and be with her in every regards, cause she's worth it <b>ALL</b>. It was her soul and nature I had fallen for, she is the one who understands me, doesnt judge me, listens to my shit and justifications, And most importantly, She is my <b>PATNI</b>, which when hands were on 20:36 on the clock got with <b>FIANCEE</b>. She is the CSS to my HTML, adds beauty to my life.
                <p>
                    <b>"FINALLY!"</b>, I breathed, once I stood up, after crossing the pile of obstacles, and finally acheived my happiness, which lied in staying with her forever and this was another step towards the ribbon I want to cross holding her hand and looking into her eyes and watching her smile with ecstacy all over.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps, this was just another step, the destiny was still ahead, had my night's sleep, but the feeling I cannot express, "Alhudolillah", I whispered with a smile and was waiting for the light to cross the horizen so I could see her again...               </p>
